The downstream consumers of a Delta Lake table have been complaining about data quality issues impacting performance in their applications. Specifically, they have complained that invalid latitude and longitude values in the activity_details table have been breaking their ability to use other geolocation processes.
A junior engineer has written the following code to add CHECK constraints to the Delta Lake table:
A senior engineer has confirmed the above logic is correct and the valid ranges for latitude and longitude are provided, but the code fails when executed.
Which statement explains the cause of this failure?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Because another team uses this table to support a frequently running application, two-phase locking is preventing the operation from committing.
B. The activity_details table already exists; CHECK constraints can only be added during initial table creation.
C. The activity_details table already contains records that violate the constraints; all existing data must pass CHECK constraints in order to add them to an existing table. ***Most Voted***
D. The activity_details table already contains records; CHECK constraints can only be added prior to inserting values into a table.
E. The current table schema does not contain the field valid_coordinates; schema evolution will need to be enabled before altering the table to add a constraint.

A nightly batch job is configured to ingest all data files from a cloud object storage container where records are stored in a nested directory structure YYYY/MM/DD. The data for each date represents all records that were processed by the source system on that date, noting that some records may be delayed as they await moderator approval. Each entry represents a user review of a product and has the following schema:
user_id STRING, review_id BIGINT, product_id BIGINT, review_timestamp TIMESTAMP, review_text STRING
The ingestion job is configured to append all data for the previous date to a target table reviews_raw with an identical schema to the source system. The next step in the pipeline is a batch write to propagate all new records inserted into reviews_raw to a table where data is fully deduplicated, validated, and enriched.
Which solution minimizes the compute costs to propagate this batch of data?

An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.
For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.
Which solution meets these requirements?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Create a separate history table for each pk_id resolve the current state of the table by running a union all filtering the history tables for the most recent state.
B. Use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a bronze table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.
C. Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn; rely on Delta Lake's versioning ability to create an audit log.
D. Use Delta Lake's change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.
E. Ingest all log information into a bronze table; use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a silver table to recreate the current table state. ***Most Voted***

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.
Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.
B. Increase the trigger interval to 30 seconds; setting the trigger interval near the maximum execution time observed for each batch is always best practice to ensure no records are dropped.
C. The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.
D. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.
E. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill. ***Most Voted***

A table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.
The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.
Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.
B. Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.
C. Calculate the difference between the previous model predictions and the current customer_churn_params on a key identifying unique customers before making new predictions; only make predictions on those customers not in the previous predictions.
D. Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.

An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema: user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINT
New records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.
Assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly, which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger once job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.
B. Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.
C. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_iogin by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.
D. Use Delta Lake version history to get the difference between the latest version of account_history and one version prior, then write these records to account_current.
E. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.
The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.
The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.
Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.
B. Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.
C. Because Delta Lake time travel provides full access to the entire history of a table, deleted records can always be recreated by users with full admin privileges.
D. Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.
E. Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.

--------------------------------------------------------------
A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.
Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.
B. Increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism, since the trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory.
C. Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.
D. Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.
E. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.
Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Scala is the only language that can be accurately tested using interactive notebooks; because the best performance is achieved by using Scala code compiled to JARs, all PySpark and Spark SQL logic should be refactored.
B. The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks Is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.
C. Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.
D. Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.
E. The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.

The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.
The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.
Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.
B. Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.
C. Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.
D. Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.
E. Because all tables must live in the same storage containers used for the database they're created in, organizations should be prepared to create between dozens and thousands of databases depending on their data isolation requirements.

A data architect has heard about Delta Lake’s built-in versioning and time travel capabilities. For auditing purposes, they have a requirement to maintain a full record of all valid street addresses as they appear in the customers table.
The architect is interested in implementing a Type 1 table, overwriting existing records with new values and relying on Delta Lake time travel to support long-term auditing. A data engineer on the project feels that a Type 2 table will provide better performance and scalability.
Which piece of information is critical to this decision?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A. Data corruption can occur if a query fails in a partially completed state because Type 2 tables require setting multiple fields in a single update.
B. Shallow clones can be combined with Type 1 tables to accelerate historic queries for long-term versioning.
C. Delta Lake time travel cannot be used to query previous versions of these tables because Type 1 changes modify data files in place.
D. Delta Lake time travel does not scale well in cost or latency to provide a long-term versioning solution.
E. Delta Lake only supports Type 0 tables; once records are inserted to a Delta Lake table, they cannot be modified.
