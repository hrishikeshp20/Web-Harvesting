</div> </div>","<li>If your peperomia plants are wilting, in spite of regular watering, the plant is likely not getting enough oxygen to the roots.</li><li>Keep the peperomia leaves dry and provide good air circulation to prevent diseases.<h3>Peperomia Magnoliifolia care</h3>
<p>It is occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world, though concentrated in Central America and northern South America. A limited number of species (around 17) are found in Africa.Most Peperomia species can be relatively easily propagated from leaf cuttings, similar to the way African violets are propagated. Remove large leaves with their stalks (petioles) and bury in seedling starting soil. Use of a rooting hormone can increase odds of success. Place the cutting in a warm, bright place until new growth emerges.</p>

<td>Peperomia do well in light to moderate light, such as found in a northern or east-facing window. They can be easily grown under fluorescent lights.</td>

<h3>Peperomia Magnoliifolia special feature</h3>

<h3>Peperomia Magnoliifolia uses</h3>

<p><b>Ornamental Use:</b></p>
<ul>

<p>The Christmas cactus is easily propagated by cutting a short Y-shaped segment from the stem tips. Make certain, however, that the cutting is taken from healthy plant foliage only. Plant the segment approximately a quarter of its length deep in the slightly sandy soil. Moisten evenly and place the cutting in a well-lit area, staying away from any direct sunlight. <br><br>To root cuttings for new plants, cut back shoots from the tips, cut at the second joint of each tip. The cutting should show signs of growth within a few weeks, at which time the plant can be transferred to another container, if desired, with a looser potting soil mix of compost, loam, and sand.</p>

<p>They make good houseplants, but require bright, filtered light and humid air.<br><br>Propagate from runners between late winter and early spring. Of the commonly cultivated ferns, the Boston fern is the most tolerant to drought. The fern thrives best in humid conditions, so when grown as a houseplant it becomes necessary to mist the plant when relative humidity falls below around 80%. </p>

</div> </div>","<li>Adequate watering is of course, essential, but over-watering is above all the greatest cause of the demise of virtually all Aralias.</li><li>It is generally thought that plants will thrive when kept on the dry side. </li><li>False aralia does not like to be moved. A sudden change in location causes the leaves to drop off. </li><li>Trimming the tips of an Aralia Plant helps promote new growth. </li><li>Handpick as many of the mealybugs from the plant as possible. </li><li>Treat the areas near the base of the leaves with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol every five days, especially where you see the cottony masses of insects. </li><li>Insecticidal soap is helpful when mealybugs are in the crawling stage before they attach to the foliage and assume their cottony appearance.</li><li>Fertilize every two weeks with liquid houseplant fertilizer in spring and summer and monthly in fall and winter.<h3>Aralia Miniature White care</h3>
<p>Aralia plants can propagate by stem cuttings. Propagating aralia plants is more successful when temperatures are above 21 degrees C. Take softwood, or green-tip, cuttings from an aralia plant in the summer, using the top 10 inches of the plant. Strip the majority of the leaves from the bottom of the stems, then place them upright into a pot of moist, sandy soil.<br> The stems will begin to root after a few days. When the plant gets larger, transfer it to a new pot or your garden.</p>
